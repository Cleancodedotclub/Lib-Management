MERN Stack for Library Management System is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) for managing books in a library. The application allows librarians to manage their book collections, as well as track loans and returns of books.

The repository includes a set of server-side and client-side code. The server-side code is built using Node.js and Express, and uses MongoDB as the database to store and retrieve book information. The client-side code is built using React, and includes components for rendering the library management interface and handling user interactions.

The application includes features like book search and filtering, adding new books, updating book information, tracking book loans and returns, and generating reports. Users can create accounts, log in, and view their borrowing history. The app also includes email notifications and reminders to keep users informed about their borrowing statuses.

The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels. The repository includes detailed instructions for setting up and running the app locally.
